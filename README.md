# Rasterizer

<h3 align="center">A Rasterizer is the process of taking vectorial coordinates and making them into 3d objects that are converted on a 2d plan to be visualized on a digital screen. It&#39;s the base of 3d modeling and 3d viewing. There are multiple steps in the Rasterization process such as the conversion of 3d coordinates into a 2d RGB color table, the calculation of light in a scene and how it reflects on other objects, the camera movement...</h3>

## To Compile and launch the compilation

```sh
make
```
```sh
./Rasterizer
```
## Diagrame of the project control:

You can right click to activate the camera and press space to get out

## Difficulties:

Most problems came frome the code understanding and how 3d space work with math. It was a difficult project most function were time consuming to implement.
The lag of a code not working make it difficult to debbug and understand the problems. It was a bit of a blind search.
