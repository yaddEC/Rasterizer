# Rasterizer

<h3 align="center">A Rasterizer is the process of taking vectorial coordinates and making them into 3d objects that are converted on a 2d plan to be visualized on a digital screen. It&#39;s the base of 3d modeling and 3d viewing. There are multiple steps in the Rasterization process such as the conversion of 3d coordinates into a 2d RGB color table, the calculation of light in a scene and how it reflects on other objects, the camera movement...</h3>
